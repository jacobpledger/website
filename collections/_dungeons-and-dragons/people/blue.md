Race: Faerie Dragon

A blue faerie dragon from the Feywild. Randall and Celeste encountered it and its siblings in one of the towers of the Elven keep. They harrassed the party with illusion magic until the party escaped, at which point Blue, the youngest, decided to accompany them.
Upon leaving the Feywild, Blue transformed into a black cat, his former sapphire lustre retained only in its eyes.
