Grand Wizard of Cradle Keep. He has some history with Sahjah and Belloh and owes them payment for some previous job.
When focused on his research, he seems to take little notice of others, and is generally quite rude. They seem to bore him. He also had little regard for his hirelings, since he was willing to incinerate them during the first encounter with a mirror-bird in the Feywild.
He was captured by the Elves in the Feywild and lost his arm.
