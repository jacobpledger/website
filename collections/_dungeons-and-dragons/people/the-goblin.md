The leader of Helmcliff's criminal underworld. Known to the city guard, but they have so far been unsuccessful in dealing with him. Some connection to Sibyl regarding Randall's resurrection. Provided us with our shop.

"The Goblin" is, of course, an alias. His true identity is Ominifus Hereward Dran, CEO of Acquisitions Incorporated.
