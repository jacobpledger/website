Race: Tiefling Female

An older Tiefling and former slave, by the brand on her hand. Strange, because there is no slavery in Helmcliff. Completely hairless.
She applied to Randall and Celeste's shop, having run a former business and was very forward and open.
Animals flock to her like a magnet for some reason.
