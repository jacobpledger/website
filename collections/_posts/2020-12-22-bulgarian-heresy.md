<img src="/assets/images/2020-12-22-bulgarian-heresy/bulgarian-heresy.jpg" alt="Comic: A blue-team rider with a flail charges a chanting red-team monk. The chanting intensifies as the rider closes in. The monk closes his eyes as he chants desperately. Suddenly, just before impact the horse is stopped in front of him, now dressed for red-team. The monk is relieved until he looks up at the unshown rider and then scampers away. The horse nervously looks back at the still unshown rider. The rider, revealed in blue, casts a baleful gaze upon the horse below him as his flail is  raised in a swing across a shining sky." style="width:100%;">

I enjoyed playing the Bulgarians before I saw this, and now its memory brings me a small bit of joy every time I play them.
