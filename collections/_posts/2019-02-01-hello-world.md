title: Hello World
---
This will be my first foray into blogging. I promise to get some content up on this site soon, but everyone says that. I hope to use this site as a place to dump the thoughts rolling around in my head, though from my experience just writing _this_ it will not be easy. I cannot decide between explaining my reasons for doing this blog or simply writing a brief post. In the end, as you can see, I went with the third option. Hopefully if you read this you will find some facet of my life or the stories I tell interesting.
More later,
J
