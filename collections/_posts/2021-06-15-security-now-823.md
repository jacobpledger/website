Strangely, I think seeing the Chrome exploit like this actually shows the *strength* of open source software in terms of security. Steve states in the episode that the attackers must've been right on this when it happened, which hints that they would do the same with other high-value open source targets. Your software gets battle-tested pretty quick if it has nowhere to hide.

Steve finishes the episode with a really fascinating diagnostic and repair story.
