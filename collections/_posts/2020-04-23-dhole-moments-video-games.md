title: Dhole Moments - What Your Favorite Video Game Genre Says About Your Moral Character

> However, the economics of game development favor competitive gameplay:
> 
> If you cut NPC enemies and AI out of the game, they’re way cheaper to develop.
> Competition leads to gamers who like competition playing these games, and including some streamers.
> Streamers are free marketing for competitive games.
> If a streamer unlocks a cool skin, some of their fans will pay for loot-boxes in the hopes of acquiring the same skin (or a complementary one), so they can in turn get attention from someone they look up to.
> However, these incentives are short-sighted and always lead to a Tragedy of the Commons situation where the good players get better, and the bad players leave for other games.
> 
> You can see this in action when big competitive streamers decry a lack of “fresh blood” in competitive PvP.
> 
> The simple truth is, they don’t want fresh blood for the sake of sharing experiences of their favorite game with a diverse pool of newcomers. They just want more n00bs to score points on and inflate their own importance within the scene.
