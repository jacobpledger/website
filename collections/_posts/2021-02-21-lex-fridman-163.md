title: "Lex Fridman Podcast #163 - Eric Weinstein: Difficult Conversations, Freedom of Speech, and Physics"
---

Interesting takeaways:

 * Government isn't necessarily cohesive, despite assumptions. Absent a unifying goal, it's not crazy to think that factions within will each push their own agenda.
 * Eric states what I think is oft overlooked or unspoken about free speech - he recognizes that it's dangerous, and that the theory is that the tradeoff is worth it.
