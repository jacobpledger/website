title: MacStories - iOS 14.5 Overview
---

Helpful overview of a bunch of new stuff. I *know* I'm going to forget how to change the default music player without a UI. I also switch between Spotify and Music depending on the context, so I doubt this is going to be a complete fix for people like me.

The Podcasts update makes me hopeful they've finally fixed it so I can use it to manage **files**. "Saving" episodes might actually be sane now, so I'll be toying with saving an episode on my phone and having it download for archival on my main machine. And then comes the next major test - can I drag more than 3 files into Finder at a time without crashing the app? Can I? That was consistently reproducible *for years*.

Reminders updates are surprisingly welcome, sorting especially. It's something I either haven't quite mastered in Things, or isn't actually possible. I just want my items to appear in a consistent order, preferably by time. Getting this correct automatically is nigh impossible, but the approximations could be better. (Hint: Things - let me schedule items for evenings and/or sort by time).

Lastly, not only did this introduce me to Automations, which is exciting to nerd out about, but my first and foremost obsession now is to use it to *try* and wrangle the rotation lock to always be what I want it to be.
