# WiFi

The "shouting in a crowded bar" metaphor applies extremely well. Wifi is bidirectional. It makes no sense to increase power on one end if the other end canâ€™t talk back. Powerful signals interfere with other signals, no matter the channel or frequency. More voices, more noise. Devices are also reluctant to switch APs once they have acquired a signal, meaning that a device will hold onto a poor connection to a distant AP if it talked to that one first even if there is a better one nearby. Mesh networks overcome this via a built-in handoff protocol. You want more low-power APs utilizing mesh protocols to maximize strong signal coverage.

As an added bonus, lower power usage means less heat, which is less wear and tear on the device.
