I'm Jacob Pledger, a gamer, software developer, and geek of many things. Welcome to my website.

I currently program things for a living at [Ixcela](https://ixcela.com). Perhaps you'd like to check out my [résumé](/resume.html).

[My blog](/blog/index.html) contains an assortment of my thoughts and things I liked enough to link to. Or you could go straight to [my bookmarks](/bookmarks.html) for an infusion of cool websites. If you like what you find, you can download that file and import it into your browser.

In my off hours, I could be gaming, exercising, reading tech news, brushing up on infosec, or grasping at understanding the systems of the world.
