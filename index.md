I'm Jacob Pledger. Don't worry, I'm from the internet. Welcome to my domain.

I'm currently helping [Ixcela](https://ixcela.com) make science happen by writing software. Perhaps you'd like to check out my [résumé](/resume.html).

[My blog](/blog/index.html) contains an assortment of my thoughts and things I liked enough to link to. Or you could go straight to [my bookmarks](/bookmarks.html) for an infusion of cool websites. If you like what you find, you can download that file and import it into your browser.

In my off hours, I could be playing video games, running as fast as I can through the woods, lifting heavy things and then putting them down, watching the feeds, or just being plain interested in stuff.
