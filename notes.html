<h1>Notes</h1>

Note: I don't put navigation in these so you don't waste ink if you want to print them, but that means you'll have to rely on tabs or your <button>back</button> button.
<div class="notes-section">
<ul>
    {% for item in site.notes %}
    <li><a href="{{ item.url }}">{{ item.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
</div>
